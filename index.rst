Linear Algebra
==============

Purpose of this document
------------------------

Here you find introductory exercises for a workshop on linear algebra.
They were written for people who would like to work with data using methods using linear algebra, e.g. Machine Learning.
It gives you an overview of fundamental concepts and some fields of application.

The exercises use the Python programming examples using the Numpy library.
To work through them, very little Python experience should be sufficient.

Presentation slides
-------------------

You can download the slides for a 4-hour workshop as a :download:`Jupyter notebook <slides/presentation.ipynb>` and as a :download:`PDF <slides/linear_algebra.pdf>`.
