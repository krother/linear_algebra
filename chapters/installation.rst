Preparations
============

You can use the exercises in one of 3 ways:

- open the Jupyter notebooks and run them on your local machine.
- upload the Jupyter notebooks to `Google Colab <https://colab.google.com>`__ or a different Jupyter cloud service.
- copy-paste the code examples from the exercisees one by one.

Required Libraries
------------------

The exercises rely on the standard Python Data Science stack (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib). For some exercises, extra libraries are necessary. This is mentioned in the respective chapters.
Make sure you have installed the following:

.. code::

   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
