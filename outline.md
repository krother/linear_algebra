# Linear Algebra for Data Science

## Description

How can you analyze large quantities of data? As soon as you consider tools like Linear Regression, Clustering, Network Analysis or Machine Learning, Linear Algebra is around the corner.
Linear Algebra is a branch of mathematics that revolves around vectors and matrices. It helps to build efficient algorithms on massive datasets. This workshop will help you to develop an understanding for this key component of data science.

This workshop addresses students who never attended a Linear Algebra course. The aim is to present mathematical concepts which are a prerequisites for topics like Machine Learning and Causal Inference. The workshop will cover many practical examples using Linear Algebra to create and modify image data.

Core topics:

- vectors and matrices
- linear transformations
- determinants and norms
- solving equation systems
- graph analysis
- eigenvectors

## Detailed outline

- why do we need LinAlg?
- overview

### vectors and matrices

Example: Supermarket

- what are vectors and matrices?
- addition, substraction -> 2D plot
- scalar multiplications -> longer and shorter
- dot product -> projection
- cross product -> orthogonal

### linear transformations

Example: Tetris bricks
Example: Wall clock

- rotation matrix
- transpose
- matrix multiplication
- special matrices: square matrix, unity matrix, 

### determinants and norms

Example: transform vector image

- determinant: area + orientation
- determinant: linearly independent
- norms: measuring distance
- cosine similarity
- correlation matrix

Example: recommender system

- matrix factorization

Example: Markov chain
- supermarket

### solving equation systems

- gauss elimination
- example: base fare + per mile * km

A chemist has 70 mL of a 50% methane solution. How much of an 80% solution must she add so the final solution is 60% methane?

- linear solvers
- traffic flow through network
- timetable problem, burrito

### graph analysis

Example: Language tree

- adjacency matrix
- similarity matrix
- distance matrix
- symmetric matrix  : A = A.T
- centrality: random movement
- ML methods: clustering, manifold learning

### eigenvectors

Example: number images

- PCA
- eigenvectors
